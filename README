Reporting Based Clinical Summary Module

Module to generate a summary of patient medical record. The module utilize the reporting framework to generate the data.

The setup:
1. Central Server
- Powerful machine
- Have all the obs, encounter and patient data
2. Remote Sites Server
- Less powerful machine
- Only have the subset of obs, encounter and patient data

The needs:
- Every remote sites need to get patient summary
- Most remote sites are not connected to the central server
- Central server are available to the world

The proposed solution:
- Generation process
  - Patient summary will be generated at the central server because:
    - Central server is more powerful
    - Central server have complete set of data
  - Patient summary can be generated in bulk using nightly task
  - Patient summary can be generated in bulk from admin page
  - Patient summary can be generated per patient from patient dashboard

- Printing process
  - Patient summary can be printed in bulk in both central and remote sites from admin page
  - Patient summary can be printed per patient in both central and remote sites

- Communication process
  - All patient summaries can be transported from central server to remote sites
  - Partial summaries can be transported from central server to remote sites
    - Partial means summaries was generated on a certain time interval (last week, last month)
  - Transferring the can be performed using disk (in situation where internet is not available)
    - Transferring using disk means the file must be encrypted
